# OpenAshby: Material Properties Charts
Generate a wide range of material property charts facilitating materials selection through the Ashby methodology. These charts are sometimes known as Bubble charts or [Ashby plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_selection#Ashby_plots). 

Source code is written in Python, using Pandas, Numpy, and Matplolib. A sample dataset is included, but further material data may easily be added.

#### Data Source
Sample material data is included and sourced from the 27th edition of the Machinery's Handbook. Precise accuracy of this data is not guaranteed and some assumptions are made in the post-processing of this data. It would generally be considered poor engineering practice to design bridges based on specifications from online and unverified tools.
